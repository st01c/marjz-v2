        <h3>Short bio (tl;dr)</h3>
        <p>
          I am an Austrian researcher and curator based in Dundee, Scotland, where I work as
          <a href="https://rke.abertay.ac.uk/en/persons/martin-zeilinger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reader in Computational Arts & Technology</a>
          at Abertay University. My work focuses on artistic and activist experiments with emerging technologies such as AI and blockchain,
          intellectual property issues in contemporary art, and aspects of experimental videogame culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          I published the monograph
          <a href="https://meson.press/books/tactical-entanglements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tactical Entanglements: AI Art, Creative Agency, and the Limits of Intellectual Property</a>
          (meson press, 2021, Open Access), and
          <a href="https://aksioma.org/structures-of-belonging" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Structures of Belonging</a>
          (Aksioma Postscriptum Series, 2023) on re-imagining blockchain technologies beyond digital property enclosures. I co-curated
          <a href="http://vectorfestival.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vector Festival</a> (Toronto, 2014–2020) and led the 2018 MoneyLab symposium (London). Writing appears in books such as
          <em>Artists Re:Thinking the Blockchain</em> and the <em>MoneyLab Reader 2</em>, in journals including <em>Leonardo</em>, <em>Philosophy &amp; Technology</em>, <em>Culture Machine</em>, and <em>Media Theory</em>, and in art magazines such as <em>Spike Art Magazine</em> and <em>Outland</em>.

        <h3>Longer bio</h3>
        <p>
          After years in Vienna, Toronto, and London, I am now based in Dundee, Scotland, holding a research and teaching role as Reader in Computational Media at Abertay University. My work spans artistic and activist experiments with AI and blockchain, digital art, appropriation-based practices, cultural ownership and IP, political economies of new media, experimental videogame culture, and more-than-human agency.
        </p>
        <p>
          A common thread in my research is how concepts like authorship, creativity, originality, agency, and ownership are reconfigured in emerging tech contexts; how they become legally or algorithmically encoded in service of capital; and how artist/activist communities respond critically. My monograph
          <a href="https://meson.press/books/tactical-entanglements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tactical Entanglements</a>
          (meson press, 2021) pulls many of these interests together. Recent contributions to discourse on creative AI and non-human agency include work in
          <a href="https://www.onassis.org/culture/publications/chimeras-inventory-of-synthetic-cognition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chimeras: Inventory of Synthetic Cognition</a>
          (Onassis Foundation, 2022). My blockchain writing includes
          <a href="https://aksioma.org/structures-of-belonging" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Structures of Belonging</a>
          (Aksioma Postscriptum Series, 2023).

My practice has also featured in art publications including <em>Spike Art Magazine</em> and <em>Outland</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I frequently speak at international art organisations and festivals focused on new media and technology (Aksioma, BEK, Uroboros Festival, Zentrum für Netzkunst, among others). In curatorial work, I co-directed/co-curated Vector Festival (Toronto, 2014–2020). I also advise artists and creative practitioners on IP questions (often around fair dealing/fair use) and have served as consultant and/or expert witness on legal cases.
