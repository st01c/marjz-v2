        <h3>Short bio (tl;dr)</h3>
        <p>
          I am a researcher, curator and creative practitioner based in Dundee, Scotland, where I work as
          <a href="https://rke.abertay.ac.uk/en/persons/martin-zeilinger" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reader in Computational Arts & Technology</a>
          at Abertay University. My research focuses on artistic experiments with emerging technologies such as AI and blockchain, theories of posthumanism and distributed agency,
          intellectual property issues in digital culture, and aspects of experimental videogame culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          About a year before the generative AI and LLM hype really took off, I published the monograph
          <a href="https://meson.press/books/tactical-entanglements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tactical Entanglements: AI Art, Creative Agency, and the Limits of Intellectual Property</a>
          (meson press, 2021, Open Access). I'm also the author of
          <a href="https://aksioma.org/structures-of-belonging" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Structures of Belonging</a>
          (Aksioma Postscriptum Series, 2023), a shorter text on re-imagining blockchain technologies beyond digital property enclosures. I was co-curator of
          <a href="http://vectorfestival.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vector Festival</a> in Toronto/CAN from 2014–2020, and led the 2018 MoneyLab symposium in London/UK. My critical writing appears in books such as
          <em>Artists Re:Thinking the Blockchain</em> and the <em>MoneyLab Reader 2</em>, in journals including <em>Leonardo</em>, <em>Philosophy &amp; Technology</em>, <em>Culture Machine</em>, and <em>Media Theory</em>, and in art magazines such as <em>Spike Art Magazine</em> and <em>Outland</em>. Since 2024, I have been co-organising <a href="https://marjz.notion.site/wet-tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wet Tech</a>, an experimental sound and moving-image art event in Dundee/UK.

        <h3>Longer bio</h3>
        <p>
          After many years in Vienna, Toronto, and London, I am currently based in Dundee/UK, where I hold a research and teaching role as Reader in Computational Arts & Technology at Abertay University. My work focuses on the theorisation of artistic and activist experiments with AI and blockchain, digital art, appropriation-based creative practices, cultural ownership and IP issues, political economies of new media, experimental videogame culture, and more-than-human agency.
        </p>
        <p>
          A common thread in my research is how concepts like authorship, creativity, originality, agency, and ownership are reconfigured in emerging tech contexts; how they become legally or algorithmically encoded in service of capital; and how artist/activist communities respond critically to such developments. My monograph
          <a href="https://meson.press/books/tactical-entanglements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tactical Entanglements</a>
          (meson press, 2021) pulls many of these interests together. Recent contributions to discourse to critical perspectives on AI, posthumanist creativity, and non-human agency include essays in <a href="https://networkcultures.org/blog/publication/vectoral-agents-power-in-the-age-of-planetary-computation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vectoral Agents: Power in the Age of Planetary Computation</a> (2025), <a href="https://orpheusinstituut.be/en/publications/decentralised-music" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Decentralised Music: Exploring Blockchain for Artistic Research</a> (2024), and 
          <a href="https://www.onassis.org/culture/publications/chimeras-inventory-of-synthetic-cognition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chimeras: Inventory of Synthetic Cognition</a>
          (Onassis Foundation, 2022). My critical writing on blockchain technology includes
          <a href="https://aksioma.org/structures-of-belonging" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Structures of Belonging</a>
          (Aksioma Postscriptum Series, 2023).

It has appeared in collections such as <a href="https://www.distanz.de/en/metaspace-visions-of-space-from-the-middle-ages-to-the-digital-age" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta.space</a> (Distanz Verlag, 2022), the

My writing has also been featured in art publications including <em>Spike Art Magazine</em> and <em>Outland</em>.

        <p>
          I frequently speak at international art organisations and festivals focused on new media and technology (Aksioma, BEK, Uroboros Festival, Zentrum für Netzkunst, among others). My curatorial practice moves between conceptual, sound-based, and moving-image work, and frequently connects to academic contexts. I co-directed/co-curated Vector Festival in Toronto/CAN from 2014–2020, and have since then been involved in various curatorial projects in Europe.
          In 2024, I co-founded <a href="https://marjz.notion.site/wet-tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wet Tech</a>, an experimental sound and moving-image art event in Dundee/UK, which I am co-organising with Johanna Linsley and Jan Mertens. I occassionally also advise artists and creative practitioners on IP questions (often around fair dealing/fair use) and have served as consultant and/or expert witness on legal cases.

        <p>
          I am a passionate cyclist, and since roughly 2023 have been involved in developing humanities-informed perspectives on "critical cycling studies" with Andrew B. Bricker. This has culminated in the publication of a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-025-05974-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">position paper</a> in <em>Humanities and Social Sciences Commmunications</em> (Springer Nature portfolio) in 2025.
