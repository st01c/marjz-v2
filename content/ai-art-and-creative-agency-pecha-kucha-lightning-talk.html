<p>I was invited to give a Pecha Kucha talk on AI art and creative agency as part of the 2019 NEoN Festival in Dundee.</p>
<p>Everyone familiar with the format will know that this means speaking incredibly fast for six a half minutes, racing through 20 slides at a pace of 20 seconds each.</p>
<p>Creative Dundee organised the <a href="https://creativedundee.com/2019/09/pecha-kucha-night-dundee-vol-25/?fbclid=IwAR0UB5S7JRhfsT3otgOvQ1sFz6rHSpnj63U5kwFRDjpvSRpaNUpsrEQiyJk">event</a>, and there should be photo coverage <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/creativedundee/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=2667035196696989">here</a>.</p>
