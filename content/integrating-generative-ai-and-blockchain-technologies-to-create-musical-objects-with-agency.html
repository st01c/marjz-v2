<p>My chapter called &quot;Integrating Generative AI and Blockchain Technologies to Create Musical Objects with Agency&quot; has been published in the excellent volume _Decentralised Music_ co-edited by Paulo de Assis and Adam Lukawski from Orpheus Institute.</p>
<p>The book, published with CRC Press, is widely available in online book stores. (There is also a digitised copy floating around online.)</p>
