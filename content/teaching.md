I welcome **PhD Supervision inquiries** from prospective students in all of my areas of interest, both for research-based projects and (practice-based) artistic research projects. I'm happy to assist suitable candidates with preparing applications for PhD studentship funding. I am also available for co-supervising postgraduate projects at external institutions.

Potential supervision topics include:

* theory-/practice-based inquiries linking digital art / digital culture and emerging technologies;
* topics related to generative AI (technical, philosophical, socio-economic), AI ethics, AI in visual art, AI and music;
* topics exploring emerging technologies in relation to sustainability and degrowth perspectives;
* artistic/activist uses of blockchain technologies;
* topics in experimental game culture;
* political economy of new media;
* IP issues in digital culture;
* tactical media;
* etc.
