<p>I published a chapter called &quot;From Exclusive Ownership to Zones of Exclusivity&quot; in the volume _NFTs, Creativity and the Law: Within and Beyond Copyright_, which was co-edited by Enrico Bonadio and Caterina Sganga, and released by Routledge. The book is awfully expensive – drop me an email for an open access copy of the chapter.</p>
