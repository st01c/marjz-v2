  <em>Tactical Entanglements</em> develops a posthumanist account of agency in AI art. It shows how artworks, datasets, code, curatorial framing, and legal structures braid together to produce meaning—and how that assemblage complicates ideas of singular authorship and intellectual property.

  The monograph follows artists who deliberately misuse tools, stage legal frictions, and surface the labour that AI systems obscure. By treating law, computation, and aesthetics as material to be remixed, they expose where automation reinforces enclosure and where it can be redirected toward shared cultural capacity.
