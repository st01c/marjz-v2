### The many paths ahead...

A fairly recent addition in my research interests concerns the development of an interdisciplinary, humanities-informed framework for 'critical cycling studies' (CCS). As part of this effort, I co-authored, together with my collaborator (and cycling partner) [Andrew Bricker](https://research.flw.ugent.be/en/andrew.bricker), a position paper that was published in *Humanities and Social Sciences Communications* – an offshoot of *Nature* journal) in late 2025. (You can read the Open Access publication [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-025-05974-7). We are also in the process of co-founding the Hub for [Critical Cycling Studies](https://www.bikestudies.ugent.be/about/). For 2026, we are planning a 3-day symposium (to be held in Ghent/Belgium) dedicated to exploring interdisciplinary critical cycling studies futures (here is the [CFP,](https://www.bikestudies.ugent.be/cfp/) now closed). Stand by for updates – and get in touch if you'd like to get involved!
