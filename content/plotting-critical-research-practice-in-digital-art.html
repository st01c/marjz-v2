<p>I have a short chapter on critical approaches to research-practice in _Parsing Digital: Conversations in Digital Art by Practitioners and Curators_ (2018). The chapter discusses the experimental recodings of early computer art that I began as part of my research residency at <a href="http://www.akademie-solitude.de/de/">Akademie Schloss Solitude</a>. The book turned out beautifully – <a href="https://sallygolding.com/news/parsing-digital">Sally Golding</a> edited it, and it was published by the <a href="http://www.acflondon.org/">Austrian Cultural Forum London</a>. Free copies might still be available there – or <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/1494097#.XJkethP7QWq">click here</a> to download a digital copy. Other contributors include Addie Wagenknecht, Alex McLean, Ellen Harlizius-Klück, Luba Elliott, Manuela Naveau, and Irini Papadimitriou.</p>
