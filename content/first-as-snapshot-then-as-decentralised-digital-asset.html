<p>My short essay on the failed &#39;Kodakcoin&#39; crypto venture is <a href="https://unthinking.photography/articles/first-as-snapshot-then-as-decentralised-digital-asset">publishing on unthinking.photography</a>, the critical blogging platform of the London-based Photographers&#39; Gallery. The essay explores the implications of &#39;image-centric&#39; commercial blockchain projects on the art and business of photography.</p>
<p>I also presented a related talk, titled &quot;&#39;All Your Photo Are Belong To Us&#39;: Post-Scarcity Photography and the Blockchain,&quot; at the Photographers&#39; Gallery&#39;s conference _<a href="https://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/whats-on/talks-and-events/post-capitalist-photography-now">Post-Capitalist Photography Now!</a>_ I&#39;ve archived video of that talk here.</p>
