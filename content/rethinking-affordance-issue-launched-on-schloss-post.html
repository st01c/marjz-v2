<p>An online issue I co-edited with Ashley Scarlett has been <a href="https://schloss-post.com/category/issues/rethinking-affordance/">launched</a> on the Akademie Solitude web publishing platform Schloss-Post. The issue features contributions from some of the participants at our &#39;Rethinking Affordance&#39; symposium, as well as working papers from contributors to our co-edited, upcoming special issue of _Media Theory_.</p>
