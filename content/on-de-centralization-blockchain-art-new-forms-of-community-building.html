<p>For <a href="https://vectorfestival.org/">Vector Festival 2021</a>, I convened a discussion panel featuring <strong>Sarah Friend</strong> (artist and blockchain developer, Berlin/GER), and <strong>Mitchell F Chan</strong> (artist, Toronto/CAN). (<strong>Ruth Catlow</strong>, co-founder Furtherfield, London/UK, was originally also meant to join us). The title of our very stimulating conversation was <strong>On De/centralization: Blockchain Art and New Forms of Community-Building</strong>, and a recording of it is also available on YouTube.</p>
