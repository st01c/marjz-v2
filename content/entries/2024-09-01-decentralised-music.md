My chapter called "Integrating Generative AI and Blockchain Technologies to Create Musical Objects with Agency" has been published in the excellent volume _Decentralised Music_ co-edited by Paulo de Assis and Adam Lukawski from Orpheus Institute.

The book, published with CRC Press, is widely available in online book stores. (There is also a digitised copy floating around online.)

More info can be found on the [Orpheus Institute website](https://orpheusinstituut.be/en/publications/decentralised-music).
