Coinciding with the 2023 Transmediale Festival, I am [launching](https://tldr.nettime.org/@netzkunst/109794439786199864) my new publication *Structures of Belonging*, which is [published as part of Aksioma's Postscriptum series](https://aksioma.org/structures-of-belonging). Aksioma has teamed up with the /rosa Zentrum für Netzkunst in Berlin for this event. Respondents are **Felix Stalder** and **Penny Rafferty**.

Copies of the publication are available for purchase at the event.
