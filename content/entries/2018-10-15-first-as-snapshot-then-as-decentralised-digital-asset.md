My short essay on the failed 'Kodakcoin' crypto venture is [publishing on unthinking.photography](https://unthinking.photography/articles/first-as-snapshot-then-as-decentralised-digital-asset), the critical blogging platform of the London-based Photographers' Gallery. The essay explores the implications of 'image-centric' commercial blockchain projects on the art and business of photography.

I also presented a related talk, titled "'All Your Photo Are Belong To Us': Post-Scarcity Photography and the Blockchain," at the Photographers' Gallery's conference _[Post-Capitalist Photography Now!](https://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/whats-on/talks-and-events/post-capitalist-photography-now)_ I've archived video of that talk here.
