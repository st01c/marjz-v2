I'm in the process of completing a speculative essay on interface design and the metaverse, approached through a media art historical discussion of artistic experiments with VR interfaces. The essay will be included in a book co-edited by Markus Reindl and Fabian Müller-Nittel, which will likely come out in late 2022, early 2023. I'll post a pre-print version of the essay here when it becomes available.
