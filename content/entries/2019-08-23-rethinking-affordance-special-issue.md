**"Rethinking Affordance"**, a special issue of the journal _Media Theory_ co-edited by [Ashley Scarlett](https://ashleyscarlett.com/) and myself, is available [here](http://journalcontent.mediatheoryjournal.org/index.php/mt/issue/view/4). The special issue is the final outcome of a long-term collaborative project that also included an international symposium at Akademie Schloss Solitude in 2018, as well as a group exhibition co-curated by Ashley and myself.

The special issue revisits the 'affordance' concept and reconsider its relevance, functioning, and critical ends in the context of digital art.

It includes contributions from a diverse, interdisciplinary mix of researchers, media artists, theorists, and designers: **Olia Lialina**, **Laura Lotti**, **Shintaro Miyazaki**, **Maximillian Alvarez**, **Torsten Andreasen**, **Aline Guillermet**, **Michael Marcinkowski**, **Vendela Grundell**, **Mark Nunes**, and **Özgün Eylül Iscen**.

The issue kicked off with an [introductory essay](http://journalcontent.mediatheoryjournal.org/index.php/mt/article/view/78), co-authored with Ashley, that surveys the conceptual histories of the affordance theory in the media art context.
