I published a chapter called "From Exclusive Ownership to Zones of Exclusivity" in the volume _NFTs, Creativity and the Law: Within and Beyond Copyright_, which was co-edited by Enrico Bonadio and Caterina Sganga, and released by Routledge. The book is awfully expensive – drop me an email for an open access copy of the chapter.

Some more information about the book can be found [here](https://shorturl.at/Lecd6).
