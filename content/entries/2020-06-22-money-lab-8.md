[MoneyLab 8](https://aksioma.org/moneylab8/) was organised by the excellent folks at [Aksioma](https://aksioma.org/), as always in collaboration with the [Institute for Network Cultures](https://networkcultures.org/).

I spoke on a panel called "[Radicalising the Social Imagination](https://aksioma.org/jaya-klara-brekke-max-haiven-martin-zeilinger-inte-gloerich-blockchain-radicalising-the-social-imagination)," with Max Haiven, Jaya Klara Brekke, moderated by Inte Glorich.

My contribution, "Unownability on the Blockchain," starts about 25 minutes into the video, and a lively discussion follows the panel presentations.
