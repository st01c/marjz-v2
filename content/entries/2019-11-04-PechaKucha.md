I was invited to give a Pecha Kucha talk on AI art and creative agency as part of the 2019 NEoN Festival in Dundee.

Everyone familiar with the format will know that this means speaking incredibly fast for six a half minutes, racing through 20 slides at a pace of 20 seconds each.

Creative Dundee organised the [event](https://creativedundee.com/2019/09/pecha-kucha-night-dundee-vol-25/?fbclid=IwAR0UB5S7JRhfsT3otgOvQ1sFz6rHSpnj63U5kwFRDjpvSRpaNUpsrEQiyJk), and there should be photo coverage [here](https://www.facebook.com/pg/creativedundee/photos/?tab=album&album_id=2667035196696989).
