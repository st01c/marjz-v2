**The Royal Society of Edinburgh** has published a short case study of my funded RSE research network 'GAMIFICATION OF FINANCE - FINANCIALISATION OF PLAY' (co-lead is my colleague Dr. Darshana Jayemanne). The case study details some of our activities undertaken so far. You can read it [here](https://rse.org.uk/improving-awareness-of-issues-at-the-intersection-of-gamification-and-financialisation/).
