My chapter on the algomysticism of the crypto startup scene, and how this is challenged (or perpetuated) in digital art that deals with the blockchain. Very excited to have this [published](http://networkcultures.org/blog/publication/moneylab-reader-2-overcoming-the-hype/) (Open Access) in _Moneylab Reader Vol. 2_! (Edited by Inte Glorich, Geert Lovink, and Patricia de Vries, Amsterdam: Institute for Network Cultures, 2018)
