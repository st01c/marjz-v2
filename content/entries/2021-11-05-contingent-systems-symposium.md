"Adversarial Images Between Abstraction and Generalization" was delivered at the ['Art and/as Algorithmic Critique' symposium](http://ikgallery.ca/contingent-systems-symposium/), organised by [Ashley Scarlett](https://ashleyscarlett.com/) (Assistant Professor in the School of Critical and Creative Studies, Alberta University of the Arts) to coincide with the exhibition [Contigent Systems](http://ikgallery.ca/va_contingentsystems/), which she curated for the Illingworth Kerr Gallery in Calgary, Alberta/CAN. The panel also featured contributions by **Alex Borkowski** and **Helen Knowles**.

I'm told the panel was recorded – the video will be added here when it becomes available.
