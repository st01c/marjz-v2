<p>As part of a critical practice &amp; innovation postgraduate seminar for our <a href="https://www.abertay.ac.uk/course-search/postgraduate-taught/professional-masters-in-games-development/">MProf in Games Development at Abertay University</a>, on 5 May I convened a very casual panel discussion that saw the Austrian machinima collective <a href="http://leonhardmuellner.at/total-refusal/">Total Refusal</a> in conversation with game art pioneer Joseph DeLappe.</p>
<p>After some obligatory tech issue, it was a really stimulating and insightful discussion on the histories, futures, and critical edges of machinima. Here&#39;s the video (plus <a href="https://youtu.be/V2YxGRS-HF8">external link</a>):</p>
