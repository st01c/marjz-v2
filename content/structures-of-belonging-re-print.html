<p>I&#39;m very pleased that my essay &#39;Structures of Belonging&#39;, which was originally commissioned by <a href="https://aksioma.org/">Aksioma</a> at the end of 2022, has been included in the blockbuster essay collection _The PostScriptUM Anthology (2010–2023): Essays on Art, Technology, Society and the Environment_, co-edited by Daphne Dragona and Domenico Quaranta. The book is as beautiful, thought-provoking, and all around excellent as everything Aksioma publishes, and is available to be ordered <a href="https://aksioma.org/postscriptum-anthology">here</a>.</p>
