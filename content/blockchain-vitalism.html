<p><a href="https://outland.art/">Outland.art</a> has published my short essay <a href="https://outland.art/blockchain-vitalism/">&quot;Blockchain Vitalism&quot;</a>. The essay concerns artistic experiments with blockchain that treat code outputs as living things, which suggest a radical recalibration of agency and point the way toward alternative systems of social organization. I discuss blockchain art projects by <strong>Sarah Friend</strong>, <strong>Harm van den Dorpel</strong>, <strong>Primavera de Filippi</strong>, and <strong>Masaki Fujihata</strong>.</p>
