<p>On a panel with <strong>Joseph DeLappe</strong> and &#39;DrCanonical&#39;, a critical AI project devised by <strong>Pip Thornton</strong> and <strong>Andrew Dwyer</strong>, I gave a plenary talk with the title &quot;Law, AI, Oracle&quot; at this year&#39;s Critical Legal Conference, hosted by the University of Dundee.</p>
<p>No recording of the panel is available, but you can contact me directly for a draft of my paper.</p>
