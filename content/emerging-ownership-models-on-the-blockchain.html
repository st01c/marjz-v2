<p>A special issue for _Frontiers in Blockchain_, co-edited with <a href="https://www.marcusodair.com/">Marcus O&#39;Dair</a>, available <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/10083/emerging-ownership-models-on-the-blockchain#articles">here</a> (Open Access).</p>
<p>The aim of the special issue was to explore blockchain applications and platforms that facilitate new, alternative, co-operative ownership structures. Included are critical reflections, theoretical contributions, and case studies that consider the following questions:</p>
<p>- What ideological, technological, social, or legal structures are needed to make alternative ownership models viable on the blockchain?<br>- Where will alternative ownership models on the blockchain be situated in relation to the leftist and the libertarian discourse that has so far dominated the debate?<br>- Will radically different ownership models be able to withstand co-option into existing commercial structures?<br>- What are the roles of artistic experimentation and activist organisation in advancing (or correcting) efforts to instrumentalise the blockchain in the creative industries?<br>- What, finally, is the conceptual and practical role of tokens in all of this?</p>
