<p>I had the pleasure of participating in a very stimulating and insightful conversation with Chris Kore, Palo Fabuš, and Pinar Demirdag at <a href="https://uroboros.design/">Uroboros Festival</a>. The panel was titled &#39;Shaping the Future Synthetic Realities panel discussion&#39;, and excellently moderated by <a href="https://hamosova.com/">Lenka Hamosova</a>. Video below, and more info <a href="https://uroboros.design/events/shaping-the-future-synthetic-realities-panel-discussion/">here</a>.</p>
