<p>The wonderful team from <a href="https://rwm.macba.cat/en/about-rwm">Radio Web MACBA</a> have recorded an episode of their Son\[i]a podcast with me. The Son\[i]a expanded radio project has recorded interviews and conversations with artists, researchers, curators, and theorists since for over 15 years.</p>
<p>The full episode is available for <a href="https://rwm.macba.cat/en/sonia/sonia-363-martin-zeilinger">online listening here</a>, and can also be downloaded on all major podcast platforms.</p>
<p>Episode blurb from the project website:</p>
<p>&quot;In this podcast, we talk to Martin Zeilinger about the poetic and political potential of the blockchain, while at the same time tracing a somewhat fuzzy timeline that connects 1960s conceptual art to smart contracts, decentralised autonomous organisations and a host of consensus mechanisms.&quot;</p>
